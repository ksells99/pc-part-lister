## PC Part Lister

PC Part Lister application - inspired by the Contact Keeper app from Traversy Media's 'React Front to Back' Udemy course - it is a React application connected to a MongoDB Atlas database. I have taken the original Contact Keeper app and changed the functionality and UI, allowing users to create their own logins and save a list of PC parts (part name, type, price, URL, image etc.).

Essentially a basic version of PCPartPicker.

The app is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed here: **https://ksells-pcpartlister.herokuapp.com/login**
